          This page will show a list of all requests which have been opened
          within a particular household, and will also allow household members
          to open new requests or close existing ones.

          For example, if a household member wants to throw a party or borrow something which
          belongs to another household member, they can navigate to this page to open a request.

        <li class="mb-10">
          An assigned household member will have the ability to to accept or decline a request.
          If a request is accepted, conditions can be added. Similarly, a reason can be provided
          for declining a request.
