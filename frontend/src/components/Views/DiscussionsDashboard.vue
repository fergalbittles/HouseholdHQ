          Household members will have the ability to raise discussions throughout various
          areas within the HouseholdHQ application. For example, if a chore is overdue,
          a user can select that chore and click on the "Open Discussion" button.
          Then, members of the household can discuss why the chore has not been completed.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-10">
          A discussion will be marked as "Resolved" when all household members who contributed to the thread
          acknowledge that they are satisfied with the outcome.
