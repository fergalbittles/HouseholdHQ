# HouseholdHQ

This prototype was developed during my final year of university as a proof of concept for HouseholdHQ, a household management system to assist young adults, particularly students, with shared living.

The current iteration of HouseholdHQ focuses on chore management. Specifically, the prototype is designed to reduce disagreement within a shared household by introducing an impartial model for chore assignment. The system also includes subtle elements of gamification to sustain user engagement.
